**Quick Description:** 

As a Software Engineering students, we can attest that it could be very difficult sometimes to focus on studying to keep our grades in good shape while trying to searching and applying to well suited jobs that will enhance our knowledge and benefit us on the long run. It is also important to note that with today's competition, finding that job could take a while and could be way harder than it needs to be. Which is why we recommend that Engineering students accross Quebec use the new Jobs2Finesse platform. 

The purpose of this project is to create a career services platform where students (who are looking for jobs) may publish and maintain their portfolios and businesses can post job openings. This enables you to do job seeking from the convenience of your home. This assists both job seekers and employers in reducing the pool of candidates for employment. Additionally, job seekers will have the option to tailor their profiles to the market, helping businesses find specific applicants who fit their requirements. All you need to view the website online is a computer or mobile device with Internet access. All Students and Employers must first make an account on our online career services system before they may log in with their email and password. Students will build or edit their profiles, see job opportunities, and submit applications. Employers will manage their job postings and evaluate applicant materials. This system's login information is highly secure, and no one will be able to break it quickly. Students will be notified when they are summoned for an interview by employers and by employers when they apply to job offers.

**The main users:**

1. Employer : The employer registers for an account, logs in, browses through applicants, adds job offers, and chooses applicants who have already submitted applications for an offer for an interview.

2. Student: The students register for an account, log in, make a profile, upload their resume, explore job listings, and then apply for those positions.

3. Admin : Finally, the admin oversees all user postings and profiles.

**4 user stories:**

User Story #1 As an employer, i want to be able to filter out the candidates through criteria's such as their program major, GPA,... to hired the student that fits best with the job.

User Story #2 As a student, i want to be able to filter out the location of the job site to have an even more precise job search.

User Story #3 As a admin, i want to be able to make changes and manage existing accounts and add new ones, so that the website can be more comprehensible and manageable.

User Story #4 As a student, i want to be able to navigate to a tab that has all my submitted applications, so that i know where i have applied.

**First sprint description:**

During our first team meeting, we have discussed our understanding of the project, got introduced to each other, understood each other's strength's and weaknesses and worked on making the Github repository, inviting all of the members and working on each of our commits. We also discussed what approaches and technologies to use:


We will be using an Agile development approach through out our project and, to support our project management procedure, we will make use of GitHub, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, and continuous integration. The duration of the project is 10 to 12 weeks.  

The front and back-end will each have 2 team members working on them, while the database part of the project will be worked on by only one person. There will also be one person that will do a bit of front and back end to help get both sides on track and organize how both sides will be able to link their work and make the program functional. 

Plan for next sprint : By the next sprint, we are planing on finishing the web- development courses assigned to team members that have less experience with the mentioned technologies. In addition, we will be discussing  the website front-end design to ensure that it will meet the requirements indicated in the document by understanding how the back-end will be linked to the front-end (i.e how will the database be linked to the website and how the backend functions will retrieve the information from the database). Finally, we will discuss the efficiency of the application by figuring out which data structures or which functions will have less time complexity to use.
